Many people, whether at work, school, or another institution, are forced to access the internet through a specific proxy server.  Typically streaming media sites are blocked by these proxies and users are left without their favorite internet radio station to help them through the day. mirrorcast runs an HTTP server that can duplicate a STREAMcast or Icecast radio stream and deliver the content to an end user.  By hosting this server on a host allowed by the proxy server (eg. home computer) a user will be able to stream their favorite (blocked) radio stations.
